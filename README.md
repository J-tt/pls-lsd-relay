# eth-lsd-relay

`eth-lsd-relay` is an off-chain relay service responsible for interacting with Eth Lsd contracts and Beacon chain, synchronizing blocks and events, handling tasks related to validators and balances, and other off-chain operations. Each voter is required to run an instance of this service to submit their votes for new balances of the network, ejected validators and rewards distribution etc.
